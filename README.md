# DATA25900-IP


This repository contains my software packaging for my IP for reproducibility. The process of work is described in more detail in the manuscript where this repository was found. I would suggest to follow the methodology section or look at my comments in the notebooks. If there are any lingering questions, please email me!
This repository contains the csv used, my final Jupyter notebook (has most of the code used to analyze and visualize, beside what is noted to be in the colab space), and a colab link for what is missing in the notebook. I also added some of my failed work just for the instructor of the class just to show how I spent the last 9 weeks and some of the ptifalls I ran into.
