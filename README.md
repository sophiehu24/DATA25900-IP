# DATA25900-IP


This repository contains my software packaging for my IP for reproducibility. The process of work is described in more detail in the manuscript where this repository was found. This repository contains the csv used, my final Jupyter notebook (has most of the code used to analyze and visualize, beside what is noted to be in the colab space), and a colab link for what is missing in the notebook.
